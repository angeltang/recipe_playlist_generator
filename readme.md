# Recipe Playlist Generator

This is an app that can search recipes, look up recipe details, and generates a spotify playlist in the genre of your choice that has about the same length as the cooking time, so you can listen to some music while you cook.

## Instructions:
* Please modify secrets_template.py so that this app can modify your playlists on Spotify, and rename “secrets_template.py” to “secrets.py”;
* Run main.py; follow the prompts in the console and start exploring :)

## Note:
* All data from allrecipes.com and Spotify API.
* Packages required: OAuth1, bs4, requests, re, emoji, webbrowser, math, base64, sqlite3, plotly
